<h2> <strong> Excel 2 Project Overview </strong> </h2> </font>
<br>
For this project, the skills in Project 1 and 2 were combined to create a project that analyzed an independently selected dataset. The data I have used here is a description of the annual sales of food at home (FAH) and food away from home (FAFH). It is described in both nominal terms (at the existing dollar value) and constant dollar value (after being adjusted for inflation). The number of rows in my data is about 102 with about 8 columns. The data states the FAH food sales, FAFH food sales, and total food sales in nominal and constant dollar terms for the years 2021 and 2022. The source of this data is the USDA, Economic Research Service (ERS) Food Expenditure Series (FES). This is a comprehensive dataset by the USDA, from which I have pulled the data relevant to my project. 
In this project, we are analyzing the changes and trends related to food sales in the US across different states. The focus remains on the changes in Food at home and how that has changed over the two years. For the last couple of worksheets, the Top 10 for change in FAH in each type of sales provide a good idea of the levels of inflation that the country has seen and how that affects food sales.
It was interesting to see how the percentage change in FAH sales might look to be a positive number in terms of nominal sales, but after taking inflation into account, it shows that the sales have actually reduced in dollar volumes.
This leads me to the conclusion that the inflation in the country has led to lower food sales than what should be expected from the country which can be a key determinant to understand the dietary conditions of the country along with a key factor in health-related research.
Finally, here are all the worksheets in this workbook described:
<br>
<ol>
<li> The first worksheet “Data” is an extract from the source data to sort the data by year and also alphabetically.  </li>
<li> Yearly Constant Dollar Data: This worksheet is a Pivot Table from the DATA worksheet to show the yearly constant dollar data. This is helpful as it makes way for comparison between the years because of the presentation of the data for each year in columns. It also has filters for the user to select if they want a single year’s data and if they want to compare a few specific states.  </li>
<li> Yearly Nominal Data: Just like the previous worksheet, this one presents the same data but in terms of nominal sales. This worksheet also has the same filters (slicers) available.  </li>
<li> FAFH Comparison Sheet: As the name suggests, this sheet compares the FAFH sales for both years and also provides the percentage change for each. This helps one understand the way that FAFH sales have changed within the two years in the US across the states.  </li>
<li> FAH Comparison Sheet: Again, this sheet performs the same function as above for FAH sales for both years. </li>
<li> FAH Change Graph: This is a Pivot Table and Chart that puts the nominal and constant dollar change in FAH between the two years side by side for easier comparison, and allows user to narrow down specific states to look at how their charts may compare. </li>
<li> NominalFAHChangeTop10: This filtered worksheet gives you a look at the Top 10 states that had the most change in their FAH Nominal food sales per capita between 2021 and 2022. </li>
<li> Const$FAHChangeTop10: This filtered worksheet gives you a look at the Top 10 states that had the most change in their FAH Constant dollar food sales per capita between 2021 and 2022. </li>
<li> Request State Summary: This interactive worksheet allows the user to look at a summary of the data for one state at a time. It also presents this data in a clustered column chart. This sheet is protected to ensure that the user does not accidentally change the formula to incorrectly present the data. </li>
<li> Feedback: This worksheet asks for the user’s input about the project overall by asking for a rating and then providing my email for them to share more about it. </li>

</ol>
