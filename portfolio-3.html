Hello, my name is Rashi. I am currently studying Business Analytics and Information Systems at the Muma College of Business and the Judy Genshaft Honors College at the University of South Florida, Tampa, FL. A member of the Bulls Business Community, I am enthusiastic about data, numbers, and statistics and look forward to starting as a Data or Business Analyst after graduating. As of now, I am working as a Student Worker at the Office of Admissions at USF Tampa. I am also a Captian for the Bulls Nakhra dance team, where I am responsible for the overall management of the team members, budgets, choreographies and much more.

As a part of my coursework, I have completed several projects throughout my time at USF. I will be linking said projects below:
