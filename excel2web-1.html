<h2> <strong> Excel 2 Project Overview </strong> </h2> </font>
<br>
<font color="white">
Similar to Excel Project 1, this was designed to further display my skills in basic Excel functions and tools. Here, medical data for different states provided by my ISM3011 course was used to create a workbook that displays this data in different ways. The project consisted of different worksheets designed to present the summarized data for a specific state, pivot tables with specific goals, etc. Here is a list of the functions, tools, and excel features used in this project:   
<br>
<ul>
<li> Data Validation </li>
<li> SUM, IF, VLOOKUP and other functions </li>
<li> Naming cell ranges and referencing them </li>
<li> Adding and designing different kinds of borders to cells and tables </li>
<li> Changing font properties and cell background colors</li>
<li> Displaying graphic representation of data in specific cells </li>
<li> Using pivot tables and charts with slicers </li>
<li> Sorting lists and using filters to display desired results </li>
<li> Protecting and locking cells in a sheet </li>
<li> Creating and renaming worksheets in the document </li>
</ul>

<br>
Different worksheets served different purposes. For example, the <b> Comparisons </b> worksheet showed the comparison of medical data for two different states, as entered by the user. This was also presented graphically as a pie chart. After this, the worksheets <b> Pivot 1, 2, and 3 </b> were created from the Medical Data sheet to display specific arithmetic values of particular fields in the data. Similarly, <b>Filter 1 and Filter 2 </b> are worksheets that display states with an above-average total policy score and states that limit charges to low-income and provide accurate itemized bills respectively. <b> Filter 3 </b> was independently created to display the states that restrict denial of patient care based on finances while also limiting surprise billing. Here are illustrations of the project: </font>
