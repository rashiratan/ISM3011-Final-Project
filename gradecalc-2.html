<h3>
The grade calculator project was a part of my ISM3011 course, where we were required to create an Excel file that calculates grades for students in a provided format of grades that was based on a typical ISM3011 course. To give you an idea of what this looked like, here are screenshots of the project:
<br>
<table border=0>
<tr> 
<td>
<img src="gradecalcscreenshot1.png" width="40% height="40%">
</td>
<td>
<img src="gradecalcscreenshot2.png" width="80% height="80%">
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>

The project was used to enable users to calculate their final grade simply by plugging in their scores for the different assignments and homeworks given during the course. 
Here, there were a variety of Excel functions and tools used during the project, not limited to but including the following:
</h3>
<h4>
<br>
<ul>
<li> Data Validation </li>
<li> SUM, IF, VLOOKUP and other functions </li>
<li> Naming cell ranges and referencing them</li>
<li> Adding and designing different kinds of borders to cells and tables</li>
<li> Changing font properties and cell background colors</li>
<li> Freezing rows and columns </li>
<li> Protecting and locking cells in a sheet </li>
<li> Creating and renaming worksheets in the document </li>
</ul>
</h4>
<p>

I learned a lot of different skills, functions and tools of Excel. As someone who has had a pretty good experience with Excel, this project was the perfect refresher that I needed on all these basic functions of Excel that are so essential for anyone to know. </h3>
